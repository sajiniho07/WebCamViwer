# OpenCV Video Frame Manipulation

This program uses OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam and displays them on-screen in real-time, with various manipulations applied. The manipulations include:

- Creating a normal frame with the current time and developer name overlaid.
- Creating a red frame.
- Creating an inversed version of the original frame.
- Creating a gray scale version of the original frame.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV

## Installation
```
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```

## How to Use
1- Connect your webcam to your computer.
Run the script.

2- A window will appear showing the live video stream from your webcam.

3- The program applies the four different manipulations to each frame of the video in real-time.

4- Press 'q' key to exit the program.
